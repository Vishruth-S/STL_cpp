# The Two Sum Problem

This is a classic algorithmic interview question. There are many different solution routes,
each of which involves a different technique.

### Problem Statement:
You are given an array of n integers and a number k. Determine whether there is a pair
of elements in the array that sums to exactly k. For example, given the array [1, 3, 7] and
k = 8, the answer is “YES,” but given k = 6 the answer is “NO”.

#### Example 1
Input: arr = [15, 11, 2, 3] , k = 5   
Output: YES    
Explanation: (2,3) satisfies the condition    
  
#### Example 2 
Input: arr = [5, 4, 1, 2] , k = 8   
Output: NO    
Explantion: No pair with sum = 8 exists. Note that (4,4) is invalid since same element can't be used twice.
